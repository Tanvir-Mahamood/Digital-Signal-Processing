2. Take discrete time signals and apply following properties: 
   - Addition, Multiplication 
   - Shifting 
   - Scaling

# Lab 3
## Tasks: 
1. Take 2 discrete time causal signals and apply convolution. 
2. Generate a discrete time signal with sharp transitions. Apply proper averaging filter on it 
and show the effects. 
3. Generate a sinusoidal signal. Apply random noise on it. Use proper filter to denoise the 
signal and show the effects. 
4. Take 2 discrete time signals and show the correlation between them in different time 
delay and try to interpret the purpose.

# Lab 4
## Tasks: 
1. Take a sinusoid of a fundamental frequency and some of its harmonics. Show the 
generated periodic signal using the components. 
2. You are given the Fourier coefficients of a signal: 
   C<sub>k</sub> = Aa/T, if k = 0
   C<sub>k</sub> = (Aa/T)sinc(ùúãùëòùëìa), otherwise
   - Plot the coefficients in the frequency domain.  
   - Generate the power density spectrum. 
   - Generate the original signal using the synthesis equation.
